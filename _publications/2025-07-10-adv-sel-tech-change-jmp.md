excerpt: "New medical technologies -- from GLP-1s to novel treatments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) -- are increasingly expensive. These  high-cost innovations make generous health insurance coverage more valuable for individuals at risk of needing new therapies. However, if those individuals are also costlier to insure, innovation may generate adverse selection. I develop a conceptual framework to study this trade-off and examine it empirically using data from Medicare Part D, the prescription drug insurance program for the elderly. I first show that an innovation shock driven by high-cost new drug approvals in the mid-2010s generated substantial adverse selection against generous Part D plans providing additional coverage for those drugs in the `donut hole,' increasing average costs for these plans by 35%. In the years following the shock, the market exhibits hallmark patterns of dynamic adverse selection: switchers into generous coverage are high-cost and more likely to use new drugs; premiums rise by 52%; and price sensitive low-cost enrollees switch out of generous plans. Ultimately, the market partially unravels, as the market share for the generous plans falls by 50%. The welfare costs of this unraveling are substantial. In the post-innovation period, equilibrium social welfare falls sharply relative to the pre-innovation period, and the equilibrium allocation achieves just 36% of the social surplus that would be attained at the ex-ante efficient level of coverage. Part D's robust reinsurance policies limit these losses, however, and I show that counterfactual reductions in reinsurance lead to the near total unraveling of generous coverage. These results underscore the importance of such policies for stabilizing insurance markets as high-cost new medical innovation continues to accelerate."
