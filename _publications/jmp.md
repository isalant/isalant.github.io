title: "The Impacts of Privatization: Evidence from the Home Health Care Setting"
collection: publications
category: jmp
excerpt: 'In many sectors, privatization is pursued to improve efficiency but raises concerns about cost-cutting and underprovision. In health care, however, the dominant margin of response may be overprovision—higher spending driven by billing and coding efforts rather than by increased value. I study this mechanism in the context of Arkansas’s 2016 sale of its statewide public home health agency network to a national for-profit chain. A stylized model predicts that privatization shifts managerial attention toward billing effort—resources devoted to documentation, coding, and service mix decisions—that raise the effective reimbursement per episode and expand care along an upward-sloping cost curve. Consistent with these predictions, difference-in-differences estimates using Medicare data from 2010–2021 show that privatization increased effective reimbursement per episode by 27 percent and statewide home health use by roughly 10 percent, with no evidence of reduced access for high-cost or rural populations. Spending rose substantially, but measurable quality and outcomes remained flat. These findings suggest that when payment is endogenous to provider behavior, privatization may reshape the trade-offs typically associated with ownership change, increasing spending and access without necessarily increasing the value of care.'
