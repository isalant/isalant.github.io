title: "The Impacts of Privatization: Evidence from the Home Health Care Setting"
collection: publications
category: jmp
excerpt: 'Privatization can alter how providers respond to payment incentives, with implications for both spending and access. I study this interaction in the context of Arkansas’s 2016 sale of its statewide public home health agency network to a national for-profit chain. Using Medicare data from 2010–2021 and difference-in-differences designs, I show that privatization induced a strategic supply response: agencies increased coding, documentation, and service mix adjustments that raised the effective reimbursement per episode by 27 percent. This expansion in billing effort led to broad growth in home health use across the state, with no evidence of reduced access for high-cost or rural populations. Contrary to classic models emphasizing cost cutting or cream skimming, privatization intensified revenue-raising effort and expanded service along an upward-sloping cost curve. Spending on home health care rose substantially, but measurable quality and outcomes did not improve. These findings suggest that when payment is endogenous to provider behavior, privatization may reshape the trade-offs typically associated with ownership change, increasing spending without necessarily increasing the value of care.'
