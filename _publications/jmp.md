title: "The Impacts of Privatization: Evidence from the Home Health Care Setting"
collection: publications
category: jmp
excerpt: 'This paper studies the effects of an ownership transition in home health care by analyzing Arkansas’ 2016 sale of its statewide public agency network to a national for-profit chain. Using Medicare claims from 2010–2021 and difference-in-differences design, I estimate both agency-level and market-level impacts. Privatization led to sharp increases in service intensity — including therapy visits and coded complexity — with episode payments rising by 27%. Home health use expanded by 10% at the state level, while clinical outcomes such as hospitalizations and mortality remained flat. A stylized model highlights how billing effort, strategic documentation and service mix can raise the effective price of care, inducing supply expansion. I also consider alternative explanations such as marketing effort or operational efficiencies. While access expanded, the welfare implications depend on the relative costs and value of the additional care delivered.'
