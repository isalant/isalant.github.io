excerpt: 'This paper examines how Medicare payment policy influences the supply of home health agencies (HHAs). I exploit a 2006 reform that redefined the geographic boundaries used to calculate Medicare’s home health wage index, creating plausibly exogenous variation in episodebased payment rates across local markets. Using national provider data from 2002–2022 and an event study design, I find that HHAs respond to negative payment shocks by reducing employment and slowing entry, while responses to positive shocks are more muted—consistent with alreadyhigh Medicare margins reducing the incentive to expand. A case study of California suggests that these supply-side changes do not translate into short-run changes in utilization. These findings shed light on how regulated prices shape firm behavior and market structure in a low-fixed-cost segment of the health care sector.'
