excerpt: 'This paper examines how Medicare payment policy influences the supply of home health agencies (HHAs). I exploit a 2006 reform that redefined the geographic boundaries used to calculate Medicare’s home health wage index, creating plausibly exogenous variation in episode-based payment rates across local markets. Using national provider data from 2002–2022 and an event study design, I find that HHAs respond to negative payment shocks by reducing employment and slowing entry, while responses to positive shocks are more muted—consistent with already-high Medicare margins reducing the incentive to expand. A case study of California suggests that these supply-side changes do not translate into short-run changes in utilization. These findings shed light on how regulated prices shape firm behavior and market structure in a low-fixed-cost segment of the health care sector.'
